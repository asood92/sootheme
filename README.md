# Soothe Me
This is a simple mindful breathing page.

It's based on the 4-7-8 breathing principle which entails:
inhaling through the nose for 4 seconds, holding for 7, then slowly exhaling through the mouth for 8

The intention is to reduce acute distress by guiding the user through the breathing exercise, accompanying along with calming visuals. I initially designed/thought of it for my own use as it's a practice I get a lot of benefit from, but if it helps me I'm sure it can help others.
